Title:
Demystifying normalized difference vegetation index for greenness exposure assessment and policy interventions in green cities

Aim of the thesis:
A large volume of nature and health research mainly uses normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for measuring greenness exposure. However, little is known about what NDVI measures in terms of vegetation types (e.g., grass, canopy coverage) within certain analysis zones (e.g., 500m buffer). Additionally, little is explored on how changes in NDVI (e.g., per 0.1 increments) should be interpreted for policy intervention of urban greening. Therefore, this study aims to demystify NDVI by first investigating the sensitivity of NDVI values in relation to vegetation types and second by exploring how specific value increments of NDVI reflect changes in vegetation types and total greenness percentage.
